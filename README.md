# Mathematical Ciphers
A Stamatics 2024 Summer Project, IIT Kanpur

## Overview

Welcome to the Mathematical Ciphers Project!

Dive into the fusion of mathematics and cryptography. Beginning with number theory essentials like Euclid’s algorithm and Fermat’s little theorem, we traverse abstract algebra's terrain of Group Theory, Rings, and Fields. Transitioning to practical applications, we unravel key exchange algorithms such as RSA, culminating in the study of AES encryption. Join us in decoding the language of numbers to secure digital communication.

This repository contains a collection of classical and modern ciphers implemented using mathematical techniques. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning, experimenting, and utilizing various cryptographic algorithms.
